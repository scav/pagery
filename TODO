TODO LIST PAGERY
=================
DefaultTransformer.class -

Use String of content instead of path pointing to content.
    Enables easier testing as well as more safety.


3.  parse build based on folder location
        /posts/post1.md|post2.md|post3.md etc...
        /pages/about.md|contact.md etc...
        /postpage (index)



4.  connect build together based on metadata
        - categories
        - author
        - dates(?)



5.  write tests for everything



6.  Command line tool
=====================
    Design the actual command line tool for use by projects.

    Commands to support:
        - init (initializes an empty project with demo file and structure)
        - export (exports a project to somewhere)
            - host (ssh, ftp, scp)
            - docker (creating a ngnix based docker image of the page)
            - docker-host (pushing docker container to host)

    Future commands:
        - validate (validates the project based on html and pagery markers)
        - backup (creates a date-title.zip of the project)
        - init-scaffold (more advance init method)
            -> ask to add stuff like git, bootstrap etc.
            -> ask questions to create a basic config (if users want this)

    Alternatives:
        - One command at a time?
        - Interactive Pagery shell



7.  Exceptions
==============
    Create exceptions for malformed pagery / markdown
    In order to avoid templates with errors, some elements need
    to either provide a null check or cast exceptions when expected
    elements are not found.
